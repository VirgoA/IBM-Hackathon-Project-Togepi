# Togepi Frontend

## Introduction
This is the React part of Project Togepi.
It is responsible to the dispatcher dashboard.

## Togepi Frontend flow
When loading the dashboard, it requests the events from Togepi Backend, lists them on the screen, and using Google Maps, shows them on a map.
Then, each event can be requested specifically, and then its reports are shown - text reports and image reports.
In the specific event screen (In the future), the dispatcher could tend to the event, by ambulance or police dispatching or transferring the report to a non-emergency call center.
